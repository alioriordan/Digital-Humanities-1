<p><center>I found this article to be an intriguing read. I was assigned only one section, section twenty, but it felt like every section was unique and interesting. They were all like pieces in a puzzle that fit together perfectly. The comparison between AI and biodiversity through the common thread of enclosure is what I found the most interesting. How AI is enclosing knowledge, privatising it when it should be publically accessible. The value of information is now owned by huge global companies, even if the information is owned publicly. I related greatly to the worry that AI systems may take over for human labour some day, potentially very soon.</center></p>
